## 🔧 Style Notes
- The stylesheet is now stored in the css folder.
- Background image paths must use relative paths such as ../images/backmenu.jpg.
- Transparent panels and card backgrounds were adjusted to keep the pattern image visible without reducing readability.
- Shared CSS now includes a reset, type scale, relative spacing variables, desktop/tablet/mobile breakpoints, Grid/Flexbox layout rules, focus states, hover/active states, and reduced-motion support.
- Content images use responsive `srcset`/`sizes` attributes, with a `picture` example on the About page.
